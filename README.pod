=head1 NAME

Dir::ls - List the contents of a directory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Dir::ls;
  
  print "$_\n" for ls '.';
  
  print "$_: ", -s "/foo/bar/$_", "\n" for ls '/foo/bar', {all => 1, sort => 'size'};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the function L</"ls">, which returns the contents of a directory in a
similar manner to the GNU coreutils command L<ls(1)>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 ls

  my @contents = ls $dir, \%options;

Takes a directory path and optional hashref of options, and returns a list of
items in the directory. Like in L<ls(1)>, the returned names are relative to
the passed directory path, so if you want to use a filename (such as passing it
to C<open> or C<stat>), you must prefix it with the directory path that was
passed.

By default, hidden files and directories (those starting with C<.>) are
omitted, and the results are sorted by name according to the current locale
(see L<perllocale> for more information).

Accepts the following options:

=over 2

=item a

=item all

Include hidden files and directories.

=item A

=item almost-all

Include hidden files and directories, but not C<.> or C<..>.

=item c

Sort by ctime (change time) in seconds since the epoch.

=item f

Equivalent to passing C<all> and setting C<sort> to C<none>.

=item r

=item reverse

Reverse sort order (unless C<U> or C<< sort => 'none' >> specified).

=item sort

Specify sort algorithm other than the default sort-by-name. Valid values are:
C<none>, C<extension>, C<size>, C<time>, or C<version>.

=item S

Sort by file size in bytes (descending). Equivalent to C<< sort => 'size' >>.

=item t

Sort by mtime (modification time) in seconds since the epoch. Equivalent to
C<< sort => 'time' >>.

=item u

Sort by atime (access time) in seconds since the epoch.

=item U

Return entries in directory order (unsorted). Equivalent to
C<< sort => 'none' >>.

=item v

Sort naturally by version numbers within the name. This sort algorithm ignores
the current locale. Equivalent to C<< sort => 'version' >>.

=item X

Sort by (last) file extension, according to the current locale. Equivalent to
C<< sort => 'extension' >>.

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

This is only an approximation of L<ls(1)>. It makes an attempt to give the same
output under the supported options, but there may be differences in edge cases.
Weird things might happen with sorting of non-ASCII filenames, or on
non-Unixlike systems. Lots of options aren't supported yet. Patches welcome.
